-----------------------

Flow of webpage:
- When users access the website, they would be greeted with a start game page where they would be introduced to the game mechanics and press a start button when ready.
- We made this page so that when the user loads the webpage, the timer does not start counting. We want the user to understand the game and be ready before proceeding.
- Upon pressing start, the user would be transferred to the main catalog page where a the game starts and a timer would appear at the corner of the screen.
-  Gameplay
- Users would refer to the shopping cart as a task list of the products to buy
- Users would then go search for the product on the website and add it to cart as quickly as possible
- Users would then proceed to checkout by clicking on the button with a shopping icon and the number of items they have in the cart where they would be able to check the products they have bought, enter in details and press a finish button to end the game.
- Once user ends the game the timer and score would be calculated based on their accuracy of their purchases and the time remaining.
- The score would be displayed and the user can enter their names in a small box to be shown on a scoreboard after the user presses proceed.
- Players can view the scoreboard and try another round at the game
- At the end of the game, users can convert their scores into points to redeem rewards for other ecommerce sites (E.g Lazada, Google Play, Amazon, Zalora, PayPal Gift cards)
